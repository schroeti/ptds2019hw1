My favorite hobby is fly fishing. The purpose of fly fishing is to build on a hook an imitation of a fly with natural materials such as feathers. Then with a special rod, the fly is projected by the weight of a feather and a kind of lash movement. The purpose is to imitate the landing of a fly on a stream in order to provoke the rise of a trout or any other fish. 

A fact about me is that I was born in a village in the mountain with less than 50 people living all year long. In addition I do live directly on the ski slope.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
text_tbl <- data.frame(
  Subject = c("Supply chain and its latest trend", "Programming tools", "Project in Data Analytics"),
  Features = c(
    " Monday 2pm-6pm ",
    "Tuesday 8am-12am", 
    "Friday 8am-12am"
  )
)

kable(text_tbl) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
  column_spec(2, border_left = T, background = "lightblue")
