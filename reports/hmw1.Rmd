**Hobby**

My favorite hobby is working out. It depends on the time of the year and also if I am on holiday or not but I usually train 4-5 times a week. I have been working with a coach for 2+ years. 

A fact about me: On another level, I am interested in miniature trains. I used to have a train set at my parents'.

**My favorite quote**

> *"Where there is a will, there is a way!"*

**Hobby**

My favorite hobbies are travelling and watching historical and fashion documentaries.

A fun fact about me : I read the Harry Potter books at least 5 times each...

My favorite hobby is fly fishing. The purpose of fly fishing is to build on a hook an imitation of a fly with natural materials such as feathers. Then with a special rod, the fly is projected by the weight of a feather and a kind of lash movement. The purpose is to imitate the landing of a fly on a stream in order to provoke the rise of a trout or any other fish. 

A fact about me is that I was born in a village in the mountain with less than 50 people living all year long. In addition I do live directly on the ski slope.


```{r, }

>My favorite quote is : *The moutainmen leaves his village but his village never leaves him*



```{r, echo=FALSE}
text_tbl <- data.frame(
  Subject = c("Supply chain and its latest trend", "Programming tools", "Project in Data Analytics"),
  Features = c(
    " Monday 2pm-6pm ",
    "Tuesday 8am-12am", 
    "Friday 8am-12am"
  )
)

kable(text_tbl) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
  column_spec(2, border_left = T, background = "lightblue")

```


#RMarkdown Syntax

# Normal distribution

```{r , echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
x<-rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
meanX<-mean(x)
medianX<-median(x)
varianceX<-var(x)

tblNorm <- data.frame(meanX, medianX, varianceX)


kable(tblNorm, col.names = c("Mean of X", "Median of X", "Variance of X")) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = F, border_right = T) %>%
  column_spec(2, border_left = T, background = "lightblue")
```

Our results are not the expected 0, 0 and 1. Instead we get 0.109, 0.113 and 0.807 respectively. 
This is probably due to the fact that with 100 random numbers , we do not have a sample large enough to be representative of the theory. If we try the same with 1000 numbers we get closer, and theoretically the bigger the sample the closer we should get to 0, 0 and 1: 

```{r , echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
x2<-rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
meanX2<-mean(x2)
medianX2<-median(x2)
varianceX2<-var(x2)

tblNorm2 <- data.frame(meanX2, medianX2, varianceX2)


kable(tblNorm2, col.names = c("Mean of X2", "Median of X2", "Variance of X2")) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = F, border_right = T) %>%
  column_spec(2, border_left = T, background = "lightblue")
```

Here we represent the histogram of the distribution of x:

```{r , echo=FALSE, warnings=FALSE,comment=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Histogram of the simulation"}
xData<-data.frame(x)
ggplot(data=xData, 
       aes(xData$x)) + 
  geom_histogram(color="blue",
                 fill="blue",
                 alpha=.2)+
  theme_minimal()+
  ggtitle("Distribution of x")+
  ylab("count")+
  xlab(element_blank())+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
  

```


# Equation

\[\mathbb{E}\left[var\Big\{\mathbf{v_1}\Big(\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\hat\theta}},n\Big) \Big|\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\hat \theta}}\Big\}\right]
= var\{\mathbf{v_1} (\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\hat \theta_0}}), n\} +
\mathbb{E} \left[ \mathcal{O}_p \Big\{ \mathbf{D_1} (\boldsymbol{\theta^*}, n)(\boldsymbol{\hat\theta}-\boldsymbol{\theta_0}), \cdots, \mathbf{D_p}(\boldsymbol{\theta^*}, n)(\boldsymbol{\hat \theta} - \boldsymbol{\theta_0}) \Big\}\right] 
= var\{\mathbf{v_1}(\boldsymbol{\theta_0}, n)\} + \mathcal{O}_p(n^{-2})
\]

\[\mathbf{A} \equiv [a_{i,j}]_{i,j = 1,\dots,p}\]
