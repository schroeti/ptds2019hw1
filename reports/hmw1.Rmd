**Hobby**

My favorite hobby is working out. It depends on the time of the year and also if I am on holiday or not but I usually train 4-5 times a week. I have been working with a coach for 2+ years. 

A fact about me: On another level, I am interested in miniature trains. I used to have a train set at my parents'.

**My favorite quote**

> *"Where there is a will, there is a way!"*

**Hobby**

My favorite hobbies are travelling and watching historical and fashion documentaries.

A fun fact about me : I read the Harry Potter books at least 5 times each... 

**My favorite quote**

> *"Learning never exhausts the mind."*

## David Pitteloud

My favorite hobby is fly fishing. The purpose of fly fishing is to build on a hook an imitation of a fly with natural materials such as feathers. Then with a special rod, the fly is projected by the weight of a feather and a kind of lash movement. The purpose is to imitate the landing of a fly on a stream in order to provoke the rise of a trout or any other fish. 

A fact about me is that I was born in a village in the mountain with less than 50 people living all year long. In addition I do live directly on the ski slope.

\[\mathbb{E}\left[var\Big\{\mathbf{v_1}\Big(\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\hat\theta}},n\Big) \Big|\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\hat \theta}}\Big\}\right]
= var\{\mathbf{v_1} (\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\hat \theta_0}}), n\} +
